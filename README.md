# React Foundations Learning Project

This repository contains my progress working through the [React Foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) tutorial from Next.js.

## About This Project

I'm using this repository to document my journey learning React fundamentals before moving into Next.js. The React Foundations tutorial provides a step-by-step approach to building a simple project - starting with JavaScript, then migrating to React, and finally to Next.js.

## Current Progress

The project currently includes:
- Basic React setup with CDN links
- React component creation (HomePage and Header components)
- Props passing between components
- State management with React hooks (useState)
- Event handling
- Rendering lists with map()

## Tutorial Link

I'm following the tutorial available at: [https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I aim to understand:
- React component architecture
- JSX syntax and patterns
- State and props management
- React hooks
- Event handling in React
- The migration path to Next.js
